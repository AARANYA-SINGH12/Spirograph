In this program, I created a spirograph with the help of turtle module and random module.
The turtle module is used for the drawing of the spirograph where as the random module is used to select random colours for the spirograph.
With random module, a random colour is created by setting the rgb values randomly in a range of (0,255).
To exit, just click on the screen.
